I analyzed the Amazon reviews data on luggage from Amazon’s S3 server. After cleaning and organizing the data, I specifically analyzed the difference between Vine and non-Vine reviews. Vine is Amazon’s trusted review program and reviewers are a part of the program by invite only. Vine reviewers are also given free products.


From the data set of 348,651 reviews, only .26% were Vine reviews. Based on the data, I believe that the Vine reviews are giving honest feedback that is generally more helpful to buyers than the non-Vine reviews. I found that there is not a significant skew between the two groups with average star rating, 4.36 for Vine reviewers and 4.22 for others, and that Vine reviewers did not give 5 star ratings more often. In fact, Vine reviewers only gave a 5-star rating in 52% of their reviews while non-Vine reviewers gave it in 62% of their reviewers. 


I did find that Vine reviewers were more helpful. Vine reviewers had 2.4 helpful votes per a review versus 2 helpful votes per review for non-Vine. Based on reviews receiving at least one helpful vote, 53% of Vine reviews were helpful versus 37% of non-Vine reviews.
